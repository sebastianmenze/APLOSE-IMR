## Add annotations

We differentiate several types of annotations:

- **weak** annotation: a label is present on the file
- strong annotation: a label is present on:
  - **point**: exact position
  - **box**: area

For each strong annotation, there is a weak annotation associated to the same label.

In the cas you loaded an already submitted file, your previous submission should appear and can be modified.

### Add a weak annotation

You can add a weak annotation my checking the desired labels in the "Labels" bloc.

![](/annotator/labels.png)
::: tip Shortcut :keyboard:
The keys 1 to 9 on your keyboard are shortcuts to the corresponding labels in the list.
:::

You can see all your annotations on the "Annotations" bloc. In this example we have the two selected labels.

![](/annotator/annotations.png)

::: info Note
If you uncheck a weak annotation, it will remove all annotations, weak or strong, made using this label.
:::

### Add a box annotation

In the "Labels" bloc, you can select the label you want to use to create your annotation.

To create a box annotation, click on the spectrogram and drag over the area containing the sound of interest.
On click release, the annotation is created and selected.

![](/annotator/box.png)
<small>_This is an example_</small>

On the header of the annotation, you can see:

- A play button to listen to your annotation
- The associated label
- A comment indicator (see the comment section bellow)
- A button to remove your annotation

The strong annotations are listed in the "Annotations" bloc.
Each strong annotation is bellow the corresponding weak annotation.

![](/annotator/annotations-2.png)

In the list, you can see the time and frequency coordinates of your annotation.
The information can also be found in the "Selected annotation" bloc right bellow the spectrogram:

![](/annotator/selected-strong.png)

To change the label of your annotation, you must select the annotation and then click on the right label in the "Labels
list" bloc.

::: tip Tip :bulb:
You can resize a box by moving each side, or move it while selecting its header.

#### Acoustic features

When you create a box with a label allowing acoustic features, a bloc appear next to your box.
If you set the quality as "good" you will be able to specify the signal acoustic features.

| Field                  | Unit | Description                                                                                                     |
|------------------------|:----:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Frequency min/max      |  Hz  | Directly linked to the box frequency bounds                                                                     |
| Frequency range        |  Hz  | [Auto] Difference between the max and min frequencies                                                           |
| Frequency start/end    |  Hz  | Frequency of the start/end of the signal. Can be picked directly on the spectrogram thanks to the pencil button |
| Duration               |  s   | Duration of the box, directly linked to the box time bounds                                                     |
| Trend                  |      | General trend of the signal (Flat, Ascending, Descending or Modulated)                                          |
| Relative min/max count |      | Number of relative min/max frequency                                                                            |
| Inflection count       |      | [Auto] Number of inflection points: sum of relative min and max frequency                                       |
| Steps count            |      | Flat frequency part counts                                                                                      |
| Has harmonics          |      | Does the signal has harmonics                                                                                   |

All the features are optional.

### Add a point annotation

_If the campaign accepts "point" annotations._

To add a point, select the desired label and then click on the spectrogram at the point of interest.

![](/annotator/point.png)
<small>_This is an example_</small>

You'll then have the same information as for a box annotation.

::: tip Tip :bulb:
You can move a point it while selecting its header.
:::

## Check annotations

In "verification" phase mode, the "Annotations" bloc contains all the detector or annotator output you need to confirm
or infirm.

![](/annotator/check-list.png)

Here is an example with a weak label.

The buttons on the right let you choose either you find the annotation correct or not.
You can change the annotation label and move or resize the incorrect annotation.


## Add comments

You can add comments on each annotation or on the task.

![](/annotator/comment-bloc.png)

To add a comment to an annotation, first select it (in the "Annotations" bloc or on the spectrogram).
To add a comment to the task clik on the "Task Comment" button at the bottom of the "Comments" bloc.

![](/annotator/comment-indicators.png)

The comment icon changed based one the existence of a comment: the buble is filled if a comment exists for the
annotation or task.
This information is displayed for each annotation in the "Annotations" bloc or in its header on the spectrogram, and for
the task on the "Task Comment" button at the bottom of the "Comments" bloc.

## Specify confidence

If your campaign allows you to, you can specify the confidence level you have on your annotation by selecting the
appropriate one in the "Confidence indicator" bloc.

![](/annotator/confidence.png)


## Submit and navigate

The navigation buttons are located below the spectrogram.
![](/annotator/submit.png)
::: tip Shortcut :keyboard:
The "enter" key on your keyboard is a shortcut for submitting your task and moving on to the next task.
Use the left and right arrows on your keyboard to navigate between tasks.
:::

To save your changes, you must click on the "Submit & load next recording" button once you're done.
This will automatically load the next file.

The arrow buttons allows you to navigate between the files
:::danger Be careful
The navigation does not save the changes you've made.
